Application Features Description

This application provides a seamless experience for users to search for GitHub users, view their details, and store data locally while following best practices in Android development. Below is a detailed description of the features:
1. Search Screen
    Users can search for GitHub users using a dedicated search screen.
    The app uses Retrofit and OkHttp for network requests to fetch data from the GitHub API.
    Search results are displayed in a RecyclerView, ensuring an optimized and smooth UI experience.

2. User List Screen
    Displays a list of GitHub users, including their usernames and avatars.
    The app uses the Glide library for efficient image loading and caching, ensuring a smooth user experience.

3. User Detail Screen
    A dedicated screen to display detailed information about a selected GitHub user.
    Includes user details such as username, avatar, bio, and other publicly available information.

4. Local Data Persistence
    Uses Room Database for local data storage to persist user information.
    Implements data caching to provide offline access and optimize network usage.

5. Clean Architecture
    Follows Clean Architecture principles for better maintainability and scalability.
    Implements MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to separate concerns.
    Divides the project into clear layers:
        Domain Layer: Contains business logic and use cases.
        Data Layer: Handles API calls and database operations.
        Presentation Layer: Manages UI and user interactions.
    Uses Hilt to manage dependencies efficiently.

6. Concurrency
    Uses Kotlin Coroutines to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.
    Implements Jetpack LiveData and ViewModel for UI state management and lifecycle-aware data handling.

7. Git History
    Maintains a clean and descriptive Git history to track changes effectively.
    Ensures meaningful commit messages to facilitate collaboration and debugging.

üîπ Additional Features
1. Debugging
    Integrates Chucker to intercept and debug network requests during development.
    Allows developers to monitor API calls and responses directly within the app.

2. Dependency Versioning
    Uses Version Catalog to manage dependency versions, ensuring consistency and easy updates.

3. Work Manager
    Implements WorkManager for handling background tasks.

4. JSON Parsing
    Uses Moshi for efficient and type-safe JSON parsing.
    Ensures proper data serialization and deserialization for API responses.
5. Single Activity
    Use one activity for all screen, it will improved performance & memory usage
6. Navigation Component
    Navigation Component is part of Jetpack and helps simplify app navigation by handling Fragment transactions, deep linking, and UI state preservation.
7. Modularization
    Modularization in Android development is the practice of splitting an application into multiple, independent modules to improve scalability, maintainability, and reusability.
